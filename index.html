<p>Abigail Spanberger is at the center of politics once again. As a former CIA agent and three-time congresswoman, she is now in the spotlight as she being a candidate of the governor of Virginia.
Spanberger has been leading the Republican Party in recent opinion polls, and her core campaign policies include reducing medical expenses, investing in education, and taking a pragmatic line. 


</p>

<h3>Reduction in Healthcare Costs</h3>

<p>Spanberger is setting <a href="https://apnews.com/article/spanberger-virginia-governor-candidacy-c19ade683ab0dfaef67051b36791d30a?utm_"> lower prescription drug prices</a> and easing the burden of medical expenses. It is a position to promote regulation of intermediaries (PBMs), which are pointed out as the main cause of drug price hikes, and to expand local pharmacy options. She is drawing support from middle-class and elderly voters with the message that "health should be a right."

</p>

<h3>Education and Human Resources Development</h3>

<p>The field of education is another central axis of the Spanberger campaign. The plan is to lay the foundation for long-term growth by expanding early childhood education, strengthening investment in public schools (K12), and expanding vocational training programs. In particular, promises to improve teacher treatment and resolve class overcrowding are receiving positive responses in the educational field.

</p>

<h3>Fiscal and Tax policies</h3>

<p>In terms of fiscal policy, Spanberger maintains a stance that he will prioritize strengthening public services over large-scale tax cuts. Regarding the controversial <a href="https://www.virginiascope.com/spanberger-splits-the-middle-on-right-to-work-opposes-full-repeal/?utm_">'right-to-work law'</a>, it takes a reserved position of "reform possibility review" rather than complete abolition and seeks balance with the labor community.</p>

<h3>Environmental and Energy policy</h3>

<p>Clean energy transition and climate change response are also on the main agenda. Spanberger emphasized a moderate approach to minimizing the burden of energy costs and also announced his intention to return to the Regional Greenhouse Gas Reduction Program (RGGI), which he withdrew from under Youngkin.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://news.vcu.edu/article/2025/07/in-virginia-governors-race-democratic-candidate-spanberger-leads-gops-earle-sears-49-to-37?utm_">VCU Commonwealth Poll</a>, it shows Spanberger leading Republican candidate Winsome Earle-Sears by 10-12 percentage points. Spanberger received 49 percent of support and Earle-Sears 37 percent, with some surveys showing a wider gap. In terms of funds, it is analyzed that the Spanberger camp is far ahead of its opponent and has an <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/07/republicans-virginia-governor-00596374?utm_">advantage</a> in organizational power and scalability.</p>

<p>The biggest variable in the election phase is the controversy related to Jay Jones, a Democratic Supreme Court judge proponent supported by Spanberger. In 2022, Jones sent a violent text message that seemed to target a Republican figure, causing a stir. The controversy also emerged as a key issue in the first debate between the two candidates. Republican candidate Earl-Sears publicly raised calls for Spanberger to withdraw or resign from Jones' support. Spanberger attempted to distance himself from the message, denouncing it as "abhorrent," but the controversy continues as it has not made a clear stance on whether to withdraw support.</p>
